  - Discuss how productivity influences the standard of living - Explain the limitations
  of GDP as a measure of the standard of living - Analyze the relationship between
  GDP data and fluctuations in the standard of living

The level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase “standard of living.” Most of the migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.
“Standard of living” is a broader term than GDP, though. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets, standard of living includes all elements that affect people’s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to the standard of living.",What are some things that GDP does not cover that are relevant to the standard of living?,One thing that GDP does not cover that is relevant to the standard of living is the environment.,"GDP only measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, but it doesn't take into account other factors such as environmental degradation, social inequality, or cultural diversity that affect people's well-being.",What are some things that GDP does not cover that are relevant to the standard of living?,One thing that GDP does not cover that is relevant to the standard of living is the environment.,"GDP only measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, but it doesn't take into account other factors such as environmental degradation, social inequality, or cultural diversity that affect people's well-being.",What are some things that GDP does not cover that are relevant to the standard of living?,One thing that GDP does not cover that is relevant to the standard of living is the environment.,"GDP only measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, but it doesn't take into account other factors such as environmental degradation, social inequality, or cultural diversity that affect people's well-being."
1,"The World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the years after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues raised by international financial transactions, were both created in 1946. 
The third planned organization was to be an International Trade Organization, which would manage international trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to this. Instead, 27 nations signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.
The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while, and then start negotiating the next agreement. Table 22.4 shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO. Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of countries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks have taken years, included a large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of issues.
Table 22.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization
The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT really stood for Gentleman’s Agreement to Talk and Talk. The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having dozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain industries, like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like low-income countries. There were rules, exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in every case.
Like the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government with power to impose its decisions on others. The total staff  of the WTO in 2014 was 640 people and its annual budget was $197 million, which makes it smaller in size than many large universities.

2,"The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance. In a nation's financial capital market, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.",What are the two factors that influence the supply and demand for financial capital in a nation's financial capital market?,"One factor that influences the supply of financial capital in a nation's financial capital market is the interest rate set by the central bank. Higher interest rates make it more attractive for savers to save money, increasing the supply of financial capital. Another factor that influences the supply of financial capital is the level of economic activity in the country. If the economy is growing rapidly, businesses may need more financing to expand their operations, increasing the demand for financial capital.","One factor that influences the supply of financial capital in a nation's financial capital market is the interest rate set by the central bank. Another factor is the level of economic activity in the country, which affects the demand for financial capital.",What are the two components that make up the supply side of financial capital?,The two components that make up the supply side of financial capital are savings and investment.,"The correct answer is that the supply side of financial capital consists of savings and investment.

It relates changes in national income to changes in the quantity of goods and services demanded by households.,"The consumption function is a mathematical relationship that shows how changes in disposable income affect consumption spending. If the consumption function is C = c + d, then an increase in disposable income leads to an increase in consumption spending. However, if the aggregate expenditure line shifts down due to a decrease in consumption, investment, or government spending, then the equilibrium level of real GDP will be lower than potential GDP, resulting in a recessionary gap and high unemployment.",What is the consumption function?,The consumption function is the relationship between the amount of consumption and the income received by households.,The consumption function is what causes unemployment when the aggregate expenditure line is too low for real GDP to reach its full employment level.,What does the consumption function tell us about how changes in national income affect consumer spending?,A change in national income will affect consumer spending by shifting the consumption function up or down.,Consumption is likely to decrease when national income decreases because people have less money to spend on goods and services.
4,"A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other European nations that have adopted the euro.
However, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has given up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands. When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times when the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that a Portuguese central bank would have made.
These four different exchange rate policies can often blend together. For example, a soft peg exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg. Table 17.2 summarizes the range of exchange rates policy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages.
Table 17.2 Tradeoffs of Exchange Rate Policies
Global macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one currency and one central bank. The exchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set exchange rates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow's news. If the government attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing even greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.
There is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard peg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation’s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies.  
A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals. Finally, a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies.",What is a merged currency?,A merged currency is a type of currency that is used by two or more countries.,A merged currency is when two different countries come together and combine their currencies into one.,What is a merged currency?,A merged currency is a type of currency that is used by two or more countries.,A merged currency is when two different countries come together and combine their currencies into one.,What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of having a merged currency?,"Having a merged currency can have both potential benefits and drawbacks. One potential benefit is that it simplifies international trade by eliminating the need to exchange multiple currencies. Additionally, a merged currency can help stabilize exchange rates and make them more predictable. However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. For example, a merged currency could lead to a loss of monetary policy autonomy, as the central bank would no longer be able to set interest rates independently. It could also result in inflation being less responsive to changes in demand pressures.","Having a merged currency would allow countries to have a single currency instead of multiple currencies, making transactions easier and more efficient. However, if one country experiences inflation, it could lead to deflation in other countries, causing economic problems. Additionally, a merged currency would give less control over monetary policy to individual countries, potentially leading to instability in the economy."

Notice that a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.

7,"Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts, including:
The three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment
The four elements of aggregate demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports
Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs
Economic events and policy decisions that can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.","What are the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment?","The three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment are known as the ""triple convergence"" or the ""Great Moderation.""","A recessionary gap can occur when the aggregate expenditure line shifts down due to a decrease in consumption, rise in savings, fall in investment, drop in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports.",What are the three macroeconomic goals?,"The three macroeconomic goals are maximum employment, stable prices, and sustainable economic growth.","A recessionary gap can occur when the aggregate expenditure line is too low for real GDP to reach its full employment level, causing unemployment to occur. This happens when there is a decrease in consumption, an increase in savings, a decrease in investment, a decrease in government spending, or an increase in taxes, or a decrease in exports and an increase in imports. To fix a recessionary gap, the government should reduce taxes or increase spending to shift the aggregate expenditure function upward.",What are some examples of economic events and policy decisions that can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply?,"Aggregate demand refers to the total demand for goods and services in an economy, while aggregate supply refers to the total amount of goods and services produced by all the firms in an economy. Some examples of economic events and policy decisions that can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply include changes in consumer confidence, changes in interest rates, changes in government spending, changes in taxes, changes in exchange rates, and changes in trade policies. For example, if consumers become more confident and start spending more money, it will lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which will result in higher inflation. On the other hand, if interest rates are raised, it will decrease borrowing and spending, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand and potentially a recession. Similarly, if government spending increases, it will lead to an increase in aggregate demand, while an increase in taxes will decrease aggregate demand. Changes in exchange rates and trade policies can also affect aggregate demand and supply, as they can change the price of imported goods and services, which can affect domestic production and consumption.","Aggregate demand can be affected by changes in consumer confidence, changes in interest rates, changes in exchange rates, and changes in government spending or taxes. Aggregate supply can be affected by changes in technology, changes in energy prices, changes in labor productivity, and changes in government policies such as regulations on businesses."
8,"If you were born within the last three decades in the United States, Canada, or many other countries in the developed world, you probably have no real experience with a high rate of inflation. Inflation is when most prices in an entire economy are rising. However, there is an extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009. In November 2008, Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6 billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average annual rate of inflation of 1.6%.
Zimbabwe's inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend, so let's put it into context. It is equivalent to price increases of 98% per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially double. What is life like in an economy afflicted with hyperinflation? Most of you reading this will have never experienced this phenomenon. The government adjusted prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars several times each day. There was no desire to hold on to currency since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal of time getting rid of any cash they acquired by purchasing whatever food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers' salaries were in the trillions a month; however, this was equivalent to only one U.S. dollar a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase one U.S. dollar.
Government agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started printing money to pay their bills rather than raising taxes. Rising prices caused the government to enact price controls on private businesses, which led to shortages and the emergence of black markets. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed people to use foreign currencies for purchases.



How does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to function
at the most basic level? Before we consider these extreme cases of hyperinflation,
let's first look at inflation itself.",What is hyperinflation and how does it occur?,"Hyperinflation is a very high rate of inflation, typically over 50% per month, and it can occur when a country experiences a large increase in aggregate demand relative to its production capacity, leading to a decrease in the value of its currency. This can happen due to factors such as war, political instability, or a sudden increase in oil prices, among others. Hyperinflation can also result from monetary policy mistakes by central banks, such as printing excessive amounts of money or raising interest rates too quickly.","Hyperinflation is when the price level rises rapidly and continuously, causing a loss of value in money. This happens because the central bank increases the money supply too much, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money.",What is hyperinflation?,"Hyperinflation is a very high rate of inflation, typically over 50% per month, that causes a loss of confidence in a country's currency and leads to a decrease in the demand for it.","Hyperinflation is when the aggregate expenditure line is really far above the 45 degree line, causing a huge amount of unemployment.",What are some factors that contribute to hyperinflation?,"A hyperinflation occurs when the aggregate demand for goods and services in an economy exceeds the supply, leading to a rapid increase in prices and a decrease in the purchasing power of money. Some factors that can contribute to hyperinflation include a decline in the value of a country's currency, a large budget deficit, a high rate of inflation, a decline in productivity, and a lack of monetary control by the central bank.","Hyperinflation is caused by an increase in aggregate demand, which causes the price level to rise rapidly. This can happen if there is an increase in government spending, a decrease in interest rates, or an increase in money supply. Additionally, an economy that is already at equilibrium with hyperinflation may just stay there and suffer high inflation for a long time; remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the hyperinflation away."
9,"The pie chart shows that, in 2017, 94.366 million people were out of the labor force, 152.081 million people were employed, and 7.635 million people were unemployed
Figure 7.1 Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and older), January 2017
Figure 7.1 shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population.
The total adult, working-age population in January 2017 was 254.1 million.
Out of this total population, 152.1 million were classified as employed, and 7.6 million were classified as unemployed. The remaining 94.4 million were classified as out of the labor force.
As you will learn, however, this seemingly simple chart does not tell the whole story.
About 62.9% of the adult population was ""in the labor force""; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed. Table 7.1 shows those values.
The unemployment rate is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the percentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:



Unemployed rate = (Unemployed People / Labor Force) x 100


In this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 7.635 million unemployed people divided by 159.716 million people in the labor force, which works out to a 4.8% rate of unemployment. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of this calculation.

This would lead to high unemployment as firms would not wish to hire the full employment number of workers due to the lower level of real GDP. To fix this problem, the government should reduce taxes or increase spending to shift the aggregate expenditure function back up to the original level, allowing the economy to return to potential GDP and full employment.","Increasing taxes would shift the aggregate expenditure line down, causing a recessionary gap and potentially leading to high unemployment."
11,"Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits.
This graph shows the demand and supply of foreign currency. The y-axis shows the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate and the x-axis shows the quantity of dollars traded. As explained in the text, a budget deficit raises the demand for dollars (and lowers the supply of dollars) because foreign investors want to purchase U.S. government debt. The result is a stronger exchange rate.
Figure 16.5 Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates
Figure 16.5 shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E0), where the demand for U.S. dollars (D0) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S0) on the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion per day. This was roughly the quantity of dollar–euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s. Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for that budget deficit.
International financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D0 to D1 and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S0 to S1. At the new equilibrium (E1), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.
A stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.
You can also imagine how interest rates drive the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier, a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital and appreciate the exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar appreciation leads to a larger trade deficit(or reduced surplus).



The connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates,
and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the same economic connections:
a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although do not
expect the connection to be one-to-one.",What is the relationship between budget deficits and exchange rates?,A budget deficit can lead to an appreciation of a country's exchange rate if it causes an increase in the demand for the country's currency.,"A budget deficit causes exchange rates to decrease, making exports more expensive and reducing demand for them, causing a decrease in imports and therefore increasing employment.",What is the relationship between a budget deficit and exchange rates?,"A budget deficit can lead to a depreciation of a country's currency through increased borrowing, which can decrease foreign demand for the country's currency, leading to a decrease in the value of the currency relative to other currencies.","A budget deficit causes a decrease in demand for a country's currency, leading to a depreciation in the exchange rate.",What is likely to happen to the exchange rate when there is a budget deficit in the US?,A budget deficit in the US is likely to lead to an appreciation of the US dollar's exchange rate because it implies an increase in the demand for the currency to finance the government's borrowing.,"A budget deficit in the US will cause the aggregate expenditure line to shift down, leading to a recessionary gap and high unemployment. This means that the exchange rate will likely decrease because a lower level of real GDP will result in a weaker economy compared to other countries."
12,"If a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent Brookings Institution report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high compared to the country's GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:

As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.
Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.
Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in the country's ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.

The conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.
What remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth the result of third factors?

13,"Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being outside the banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the economy, increasing the money supply in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank—reducing the quantity of money in the economy.

The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of division of labor, which means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.
To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people performed—all for a pin, believe it or not!

Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.",What is the main idea of the passage?,"The main idea of the passage is that a recessionary gap occurs when the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at a level of real GDP below the potential GDP, resulting in unemployment.","The main idea of the passage is that a recessionary gap can occur when the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at a point below the potential GDP, resulting in unemployment.","What is the concept of division of labor?

Comprehension Question:

Why did Adam Smith introduce the concept of division of labor?","The concept of division of labor refers to the process by which tasks are broken down into smaller components and specialized workers are assigned specific tasks within a production process. This allows for increased efficiency and productivity, as each worker can focus on one task and become highly skilled in it. Adam Smith introduced the concept of division of labor to explain how economic growth and development could occur through the specialization of labor and the creation of economies of scale.","""The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE0 to AE1.""

15,"In the 1950s, A.W. Phillips, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession, inflationary pressures are low, but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation. Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and found a tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, which became known as the Phillips curve. Figure 11.7 shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.
The graph provides a visual representation of the Phillips curve with a downward-sloping curve.

A Phillips curve illustrates a tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. If one is higher, the other must be lower.

16,"In economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship that we can illustrate with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied, they mean only a certain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the curve and quantity supplied refers to the (specific) point on the curve.


 Supply ≠ Quantity Supplied 
 
Figure 3.3 illustrates the law of supply as it affects the gasoline market. Like demand, we can illustrate supply using a table or a graph.
A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis.
The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved. Nearly all supply curves, however, slope up from left to right and illustrate the law of supply: as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases, all else constant.
The graph shows an upward-sloping supply curve that represents the law of supply.
Figure 3.3 A Supply Curve for Gasoline
A supply schedule is a table, like Table 3.2, that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline and we measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons.
The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve, i.e. the independent variable price is on the vertical axis and the dependent variable quantity is on the horizontal, just like for the demand curve.

17,"Why are poor countries in the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise you: The trade policies of high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities widely publicized by the international aid organization, Oxfam International.
High-income countries of the world—primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the European Union, and Japan—subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $360 billion per year. By contrast, the total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income countries to poor countries in the world is about $70 billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. Why does this matter?
The support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low-income countries. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice, sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in high-income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production. 
As Michael Gerson of the Washington Post describes it: “[T]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic…keep[ing] millions of Africans on the edge of malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning about a dollar a day.  Who benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton producers, with an average annual income of more than $125,000.”
As if subsidies were not enough, high-income countries often block agricultural exports from low-income countries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries, having bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries and drive local farmers out of business altogether.
For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship for Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by domestic consumers, but also by foreign producers—in many instances, the world’s poor.
U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they could  be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar production, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the United States government sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the quantity of sugar traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in each country will return to the levels before trade was allowed.
Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons. The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no more than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20 cents, which is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14 cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than domestic demand.
In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The following Work It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.",What are some reasons why poor countries are poor?,"Poor countries are often characterized by low levels of economic development, which can result from various factors such as lack of access to education, limited resources, political instability, corruption, and conflict.

19,"When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. 

If it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession. 
If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. 
Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even create additional movements of the exchange rate. 

One concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country’s monetary policy is no longer focused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into account. 
For example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession, but it cannot do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. 
With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession, but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate. With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.
Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves. Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost, and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit.
In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary surge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by using its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs out of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign currencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can work only until a central bank runs out of reserves.
Yet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another reason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors react to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate, and as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy—when anticipated in the foreign exchange market—may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act.
